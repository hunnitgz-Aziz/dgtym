                <br>Money… yeah…
                <br>
                <br>(Chorus)
                <br>Money to be made...
                <br>And I just want it right now
                <br>Please get down or lie down 
                <br>When I’m in the grave...
                <br>I need everything iced out
                <br>Dying is a lifestyle 
                <br>
                <br>Money to be made...
                <br>And I just want it right now

                <br>
                <br>(Verse 1)
                <br>Told you I was gon’ beat your ass one day (one day)
                <br>Please hold me back, I’ma slap him in his face 
                <br>He touched my girlfriend that’s disrespect (Flag on the play bro)
                <br>I swung, he ducked, then pushed me through the desk (now that’s a K.O.)
                <br>
                <br>Why all this drama?
                <br>You know my momma 
                <br>Been to my casa 
                <br>When we were young
                <br>You were the golden
                <br>Child I should copy 
                <br>Everyone said to be like ________
                <br>Problems with you
                <br>Look, I do not want
                <br>But I am a man
                <br>So I gotta flaunt
                <br>Or they gonna call me a punk 
                <br>This morning I bought me a pump
                <br>
                <br>I’m cycling through memories
                <br>Hindsight is 20/20 clean
                <br>Now you got me back pedaling
                <br>Psychiatrist not helping me
                <br>Your childhood not so heavenly
                <br>There’s hell to pay
                <br>My L to take
                <br>I make it through
                <br>I’ll celebrate 
                <br>Why sell an Eighth?
                <br>There’s…
                <br>

                <br>
                <br>(Verse 2)
                <br>Woke up with a busy schedule
                <br>Give me revenue
                <br>I’m smokin on the sticky residue
                <br>You could smell it, wooh
                <br>Seventh period already, shit
                <br>I missed hella school
                <br>Teacher see that you don’t give a F
                <br>But she failing you
                <br>Drug game, Blood gang
                <br>Cracks that we fell into
                <br>That was not by accident
                <br>They packaged it to sell to you
                <br>Waiting on your Birthday
                <br>Practically got a cell for you
                <br>And paid for it all with your taxes 
                <br>Yeah we march but the madness will throw off your bracket
                <br>All this baggage I might trip, if I ever unpack it
                <br>Seen a black man elected, ever witness one happy?
                <br>Exactly
                <br>The reason why I’m running this trap, like it’s a track meet
                <br>Movies showed me money and ass
                <br>That shit attract me
                <br>Used to show up hungry to class
                <br>That shit distract me 
                <br>You should wanna be your own business
                <br>If you ask me 
                <br>Instead of just another conveyor belt in the factory
                <br>Ooh you think you masculine because of rap? 
                <br>I know you a pacifist, it’s just an act
                <br>And I don’t have time for you, or the Principal
                <br>I oughta beat your privileged ass off principle
                <br>There’s money to be made..
                <br>
                <br>(Chorus)
                <br>And I just want it right now
                <br>Please get down or lie down
                <br>When I’m in the grave...
                <br>I need everything iced out
                <br>Dying is a lifestyle
                <br>
                <br>Money to be made...
                <br>And I just want it right now
                <br>Please get down or lie down 
                <br>When I’m in the grave...
                <br>I need everything iced out
                <br>Dying is a lifestyle 
                <br>
                <br>(Verse 3)
                <br>Money, Power, and Respect!
                <br>That’s the meaning of life
                <br>And if there’s more to it
                <br>Guess I’ll see when I die
                <br>I’m tryna be rich as hell
                <br>Fuck your degree and a job
                <br>Once you hit that cell
                <br>You might as well not even apply 
                <br>Ain’t no bitch in me homie
                <br>You can see in my eyes
                <br>We got history, but dissing me could be your demise
                <br>Street smart, always beats encyclopedia wise 
                <br>Three course meal for dinner, I might eat you alive...
                <br>
                <br>(Outro)
                <br>Where’s the anger? Why are you so angry?
                <br>I realized that it was fear…
                <br>That’s what it was...
                <br>It was fear in my life
                <br>Not confidence, but fear…
                <br>To admit that you’ve got some issues
                <br>Because we don't wanna think of ourselves as having issues…
