                <br>
                <br>(Verse 1)
                <br>Told you I was gon’ beat your ass one day (one day)
                <br>Please hold me back, I’ma slap him in his face 
                <br>He touched my girlfriend that’s disrespect (Flag on the play bro)
                <br>I swung, he ducked, then pushed me through the desk (now that’s a K.O.)
                <br>
                <br>Why all this drama?
                <br>You know my momma 
                <br>Been to my casa 
                <br>When we were young

                <br>So I gotta flaunt
                <br>Or they gonna call me a punk 
                <br>This morning I bought me a pump
                <br>
                <br>I’m cycling through memories
                <br>Hindsight is 20/20 clean
                <br>Now you got me back pedaling
                <br>Psychiatrist not helping me
                <br>Your childhood not so heavenly
                <br>There’s hell to pay
                <br>My L to take
                <br>I make it through

<br>Before you was in the picture

<br>All of my Aunties throwing shade like (Ooh)
<br>All of my Uncles playing Spades like (Ahh)
<br>Tears in my eyes when we play fight (Stop Playin’)
<br>Quit all that actin out, keep the Charade tight (Tight, tight)
<br>Holidays came, we played a game up at our place
<br>How many whips can we fit up in this driveway?
<br>How many ribs can I get on top of my plate?
<br>How many gifts did you get this year? I’ll wait
<br>‘Round the time my father stop living up where I stay
<br>Every Friday, 45 minutes on the highway
<br>Lisa get to trippin when the liquor in her system
<br>All anyone would ever say was “drive safe”
<br>I hate, y’all 
<br>But don’t judge it
<br>Cause’ I’mma hold you down when others will hold grudges 
<br>And we don’t gotta explain to people that don’t love us
<br>The blues is mo betta
<br>The food is more butter
<br>You know we just imitate what the parents show 
<br>The bad habits, the trust issues, the marriage woes
<br>We inherit those
<br>Until the day we have some kids of our very own
<br>And we pass it all down like a herringbone…

<br>I, really wanna be your lover
<br>But I can never make up my mind, I’m thinking ‘bout the other girls
<br>
<br>(Verse)
<br>Ugh, 
<br>What else did you expect me to do? 
<br>Something special in them jeans, they be stretching the truth
<br>She put a pep in the step of the Pepé Le Pew’s
<br>And had the reverend sweatin, half the choir leapt from the pew 
<br>Ugh, if you bring her home to momma bet she’ll never approve
<br>Plus she love to ask about the one who you been exclusive with
<br>Cross her, that could be the nail in your crucifix
<br>I hear the tick-tocking now, time to lock it down
<br>Your homies sayin “Don’t commit, nigga shop around”
<br>Birds flock around
<br>We flirt a bit, but soon as I find time for us to kick it then I’m Charlie Brown (ugh)
<br>And what’s the cause of it?
<br>If it’s a fatal attraction, what’s the laws of it?
<br>I really need the attention, give me all of it
<br>I flick it up for the freaks, I bet they all love it (yeah)

<br>(Verse 2)
<br>I used to say when I get older I’d have all the hoes
<br>But my momma raised me right so I don’t call them hoes
<br>I mean I call them, but it’s just on some platonic shit (my homegirl)
<br>At least until the chronic lit, gin and tonic mix (yeah)
<br>You ain’t the man unless you got a chick for every occasion
<br>Milkshake from Mcdonalds thick or skinny and basic
<br>And subtracting an ex never in the equation
<br>No better than cavemen
<br>Had me trippin’ tryna step with Temptations
<br>But I could have two left feet and no rhythm
<br>If she did give a sec to me, it’s no kiddin’
<br>Could tell it in her eyes
<br>Need umbrellas for her cries
<br>She been telling little lies 
<br>The size of Nicole Kidman
<br>And I have too,
<br>Do whatever for that whoop, whoop, whoop
<br>They boohooing while I boo who you?
<br>Need something new 
<br>yeah, need something new… 
<br>(And the church said amen) 
<br>
<br>(Chorus)
<br>I really wanna be your lover
<br>I can never make up my mind, I'm thinking ‘bout the other girls

<br>I, really wanna be your lover 
<br>But I can never make up my mind, I’m thinking about the other girls
<br>
<br>(Verse 3)
<br>Found a fast track for paper, she made of plastic
<br>Now an hour-glass, her shape lookin’ elastic
<br>Not an hour pass without the shouts and harassment
<br>Got a lot of followers hollering for a pic, or at least an @ to acknowledge them (ugh)
<br>Teach a college course on her collagen, got endorsements and sponsors 
<br>And they promising a bag at her doorstep for the promo
<br>It’s like her big old Rihanna forehead is a logo
<br>But so goes the saga,
<br>If she can make more than her momma
<br>While walking in them clunky Balenciagas 
<br>Who am I to judge it? (Ugh)
<br>These rapper’s trickin till they outta budget 
<br>Just to get attention when they out in public
<br>This what it come with
<br>How you love it? 
<br>Or how you love anyone in particular when they coming in hundreds? 
<br>We was raised to be the hunters
<br>And providers for our mothers if our fathers didn’t love us
<br>Our sisters who get the brunt of it
<br>Run through bitches just for the fun of it (ugh, yeah)
<br>At one point you had enough of it?
<br>Settle down, you know the husband bit (ah, yeah)
<br>This the culture I was accustomed with
<br>We tried adjusting but we couldn’t get the cuffs to fit
<br>And she be quick to fistacuffs when we discussing it
<br>Keep it a stack wit ya, brick by brick 
<br>We’ll build the trust again
<br>
<br>(Outro)
<br>Oh Janice, she said
<br>You have a rich man’s  family
<br>She said “you got the boy first, and the girl second” (laughs)
<br>They wanted that boy to carry on the family name
<br>And then what was so amazing, then my son had a son
<br>And my daughter had a daughter…

<br>Got no platinums, but I’m stainless steel

<br>Lot of rats chasing a deal, they would’ve squealed, uh

<br>Nigga, is you out your mind???
<br>All the Aunt Jemima spilling 
<br>All that nonchalance is chilling
<br>Y’all your pops and momma’s children
<br>I promise you I’m feeling like the cream of the crop doesn’t top me
<br>It’s really getting sloppy Joe, somebody stop me
<br>The bomb like saki bro, this Nagasaki flow
<br>I’ll beat the horse if the jockeys don’t
<br>I could kick it but that’s not the goal
<br>I want control
<br>For the folks counting crows ‘til the block gets sold
<br>Man this shit is bananas, no it’s platanos

<br>Your heart is gold
<br>Your head is bone but heaven don’t,
<br>Do metronomes 
<br>This precious stone we’re stepping on
<br>Amphetamines I’m fed up,
<br>Please leave me the hell alone (Hell alone)
<br>
<br>But when you wake up from your slumber
<br>You feel your insides bubbling up (ahh- uh)
<br>They take away your pain, your hunger 
<br>For a while but it wasn’t enough (oohh ooh ooohh)
<br>
<br>(Verse 3)
<br>I’m addicted to the nostalgia, bittersweet
<br>Missed a lot of calls, but I never miss a... (yeaahhh)
<br>Moved to the city, now I’m slicker with the speech
<br>But they all in a costume, tricking for a treat 
<br>The pain deep, like a cleat to the shin bone
<br>Trippin’ on me, must be accident prone 
<br>Can’t dim my light, baby I been glowing 
<br>Why they treatin’ my skin tone like a syndrome? 
<br>I can’t wait to celebrate in the end zone
<br>I been sharp as a razor since the flip phone
<br>They was calling me crazy now the kid grown
<br>And how many need favors? Ooh the list long
<br>Time worth more than money
<br>What you gon’ spend on? 
<br>I been so damn hungry that my ribs showing
<br>I’m just sowing what I reap,
<br>Gotta keep a receipt
<br>Can you keep up? 
<br>(We’re living at the speed of…)
<br>
<br>(Outro)
<br>Light! Reflecting! 
<br>Everybody’s in the pool except you
<br>
<br>(Chorus - anaiis)
<br>Oooh…
<br>Indecision when the sun falls
<br>And your thoughts wander
<br>Oooh...
<br>Something’s different now you might fall
<br>In the warm water

                (Verse 1)
<br>All on them lips just like gloss
<br>All of them pictures I lost
<br>All of them fingers I crossed
<br>All of them wishes I tossed in the well
<br>I need a ride from my pops
<br>I need to buy some eye drops
<br>Peace of mind, piece of pie
<br>Can’t even sleep I cyclops quite a lot
<br>Blind folding origami
<br>Order sushi, pouring sake out
<br>Gorgeous view from the roof
<br>More Confucius from your cottonmouth
<br>Easter eggs turning rotten now 
<br>Throwing toilet paper
<br>Porta-potty mouth 
<br>Made the morning paper 
<br>Can’t afford to save a single cent
<br>Counting every second like they sang for Rent
<br>Momma say I don’t know how to act
<br>Over my shorty crib after school 
<br>Keys jingle, Kris Kringle out the back
<br>Never understood how a fat nigga made it down the chimney 
<br>In the first place 
<br>My first taste of lust, came laced inside a Honey Dutch
<br>We was watching Bubbles, Blossom, Buttercup
<br>Can’t lose my mojo
<br>Brain was too loco
<br>I’m bangin’ with Weezy
<br>The pain in his vocals remind me of Stevie 
<br>I’m steaming like Coco
<br>It’s almost a quarter to three 
<br>Do you still got the quarter for cheap? 
<br>
<br>(Chorus)
<br>Why blame it on my maker? 
<br>Won’t save me from my nature, yeah
<br>Won’t shade me from this rainfall, wooh
<br>A clean slate that’s all I’ve prayed for 
<br>
<br>(Verse 2)
<br>East side boy got the streets hot
<br>I could fry an egg on the block when Police out
<br>Birds flock to me like a Peacock
<br>Bass make her feel the trunk shake from the tree tops
<br>Never got TLC from the radio heads but I see ‘em on the creep now
<br>nd a whole lotta folk wanna reach out 
<br>Last we spoke, it been long as a beach towel-mm
<br>Kitchen hot but I can’t chicken out
<br>Fuck it I hatch me a plan
<br>I’m smoking that sacreligious with the fam
<br>We might go sacrificial for the lamb
<br>I might go trade my master for a diamond chain 
<br>If I die in vain, pray it’s private plane
<br>Know some living legends in a lot of pain
<br>Tears tattooed, it's a crying shame (God damn)
<br>
<br>(Chorus)
<br>Why blame it on my maker? 
<br>Won’t save me from my nature, yeah
<br>Won’t shade me from this rainfall, wooh
<br>A clean slate that’s all I’ve prayed for

                (Intro)
<br>Everybody in my neighborhood respected and feared your grandfather 
<br>All the guys I came up with said “Don’t mess with Mr. Jones” 
<br>
<br>(Verse)
<br>I got 
<br>Wanted posters up all over the block
<br>How you ‘posed to pose for the photos when opps takin’ the shots?
<br>Got em open with the bars, don’t end up over the rocks
<br>You niggas sweet, probably belong in a cocktail with some Schnapps 
<br>School of Hard Knocks 
<br>All them lessons I won’t forget it
<br>My energy so kinetic 
<br>My enemies so pathetic
<br>They stealin’ my whole aesthetic 
<br>I’m keepin’ it copacetic 
<br>And that’s only the tip of the frozen lettuce 
<br>I remember getting rotten tomatoes in my direction
<br>If you was salty then, by now you got hypertension
<br>The streets was a muse when I debuted my collection
<br>Receipts for the dues I been paying with my attention
<br>Cut the tension with a paring knife 
<br>Hey didn’t your parent mention, ain’t nothing fair in life
<br>‘Tis the season for me to turn up the Fahrenheit
<br>They wearing ice, quit the cappin’
<br>For Instagram likes with witty captions
<br>How ill is He with the rapping? (uh)
<br>Snip your ribbon ripping the package
<br>Need respect like Aretha 
<br>I’m young, gifted, and blackin’
<br>Even though ain’t no metal plating  my dental 
<br>My mental on platinum plaquing 
<br>Brr, Brr
<br>What happened to dat boy?
<br>They want him dead or alive
<br>He aim for your top five 
<br>With that thang off his belt 
<br>Faster than an asteroid 
<br>I got ghosts in my scope, like I’m Dan Aykroyd (Who the fuck you gonna call?)
<br>I bet they down for trading places with me now 
<br>Globe trottin’, practice my bonjour and my ni-hao
<br>Ever have a son, he gettin’ named after three thou 
<br>Da Art of Storytellin’ is to blame when I peace out (yeah)

<br>
<br>(Verse 1 - Maxo)
<br>Seeing they schemes
<br>Watch what I know deplete 
<br>Find meaning in things
<br>Lost grasp of myself, held on for me
<br>Knowing defeat ain’t foreign 
<br>It’s lessons in these scriptures
<br>If you told me to read, listen 
<br>I benefitted 
<br>When I seen lines between game and wisdom
<br>Same nigga, jottin’ down thoughts in my folks kitchen
<br>Knowin’ we gone hit been
<br>Shown that God’s gift really gracin’ the way I walk
<br>So my word is I’m gon’ live
<br>
<br>Seen the snakes sittin’ in the grass, on purpose 
<br>Posted with a smile on they face, on purpose 
<br>My eyes seen denial in they face 
<br>When the devil in the way
<br>Spread your wings then  fly…
<br>
<br>(Verse 2 - Topaz)
<br>In my will It should read “Just leave it there in the dirt”
<br>What's a Mill to a Meek? 
<br>Watch me inherit the Earth
<br>The Dream is a nightmare 
<br>We built America’s worth
<br>I need a Bimmer in between the baby carriage and hearst 
<br>I wrestled demons and my doubts, watched them crawl right back
<br>I made the Roc raise a brow, guess I’m Raw like that 
<br>They sent over a contract to own all my tracks
<br>I twisted an L wit it
<br>Then lit a fire, to hell wit it
<br>Insult to my intelligence
<br>Charts about my relevance 
<br>Talkin’ to my relatives
<br>Know my problems is relative
<br>Know once I’m in my element 
<br>It’s no more Mr. Eloquent
<br>I’m addressing the elephants 
<br>Too much pride for the prejudice
<br>I’m just flesh on a skeleton
<br>That was blessed with some melanin 
<br>Who am I to be special and viewed as some kind of specimen?
<br>Ladies and gentlemen, expats and residents
<br>Crack pushers and presidents
<br>Black beauty and excellence 
<br>
<br>Who... 
<br>Do... 
<br>You... 
<br>Think you are?
<br>
<br>(Verse 3 - Phonte)
<br>Yo,
<br>I was hours deep within a dream
<br>Playing some records with my lyrics on the inner sleeve 
<br>Until I got shouted out (wake up!)
<br>Life in a crowded house 
<br>Just tryna find some living room in a den of thieves
<br>But now I stand a made man with no tacky maneuvers 
<br>Come out the crib to get a bag then it’s back to the movement
<br>I get caught up in the act of pursuing my own dreams
<br>I don’t care about what the fuck these crackers is doin’
<br>A child born into a permanent underclass
<br>Full of misquotes and dish soaps for bubble baths
<br>Black vigilance, Black businesses understaffed 
<br>And the odds never add up, ‘cause you have one the math
<br>I’m living proof of making something outta something bad
<br>So when my children grow, they ain’t gotta run as fast 
<br>Some friendly words from a debated underrated rapper
<br>Tigallo, reminding you your favorite rapper’s fucking trash
<br>
<br>(Bridge)
<br>All that floodin’ the ice, turn off the faucet
<br>All that smoke in the pipe, got you exhausted
<br>All that salt in the wound, until it washes
<br>All that callin’ the goons, don’t wanna forfeit
<br>
<br>All that floodin’ the ice, turn off the faucet
<br>All that smoke in the pipe, got you exhausted
<br>All that salt in the wound, until it washes

<br>Who... 
<br>Do... 
<br>You...

<br>What’s good world it’s WTPZ Radio
<br>Right now we got an exclusive for y’all
<br>It’s your man Thelonious Martin 
<br>Checking in with some brand new Topaz Jones
<br>For that ass…
<br>
<br>(Chorus - Floyd Fuji)
<br>You were hotter as a blonde
<br>But I wouldn’t say I mind that your roots showin’
<br>Couldn’t wait to be a momma
<br>Bet all the neighborhood boys put the moves on ya’
<br>Why you springing for designer? 
<br>A white tee with some jeans, it’s a look for ya’
<br>Gold is leaking through the blinds
<br>We ain’t sleeping through the night… 
<br>
<br>(Verse 1 - Topaz)
<br>They say sex is a weapon, I think it’s a narcotic 
<br>Niggas starin’ at her titties, couldn’t stick to the topic 
<br>Outside the club with no plug, that’ll fit in the socket
<br>Carry the clutch for the blush, lipstick in the pocket
<br>Pay the phone, cable, rent, when she get the deposit
<br>She tryna keep her waist thin as skeletons in her closet
<br>She got her “round the way” fit and her runway fresh
<br>They want that little black dress and Sunday’s best
<br>If she do go on a date, it’s typically through an app and five 
<br>Minutes into dinner, realizing he doesn’t appetize her
<br>Spacing out at the table, say I’m an astronaut
<br>I told her all the places I’d take her if I had a rocket
<br>Red glare, brake lights, I’m a playwright 
<br>We all putting on a show to hide the stage fright
<br>Take a bow, they throwing flowers at your feet
<br>Know you proud to tell them all about how I was counting sheep on you…

<br>You were hotter as a blonde

<br>We ain’t sleeping through the night… 
<br>
<br>(Verse 2 - Topaz)
<br>They say sex is a weapon, you my executioner
<br>In that dress, thought you could have stood next to Lucifer
<br>Hot mess but I clean up nice, you gotta say
<br>Take a life if that’s really the price I gotta pay
<br>I’m not a player, I’m just crushing on you love
<br>Might tell a lie if you ask is it true love
<br>Two doves, one stone don’t always do it
<br>Ask my dogs, yeah we all been through it
<br>Why do I try so hard to hide myself? (myself)
<br>And end up sitting here beside myself (myself)
<br>With these 
<br>Long faces, like Earth, Wind, and Fire bassist	
<br>And cars race, but not at this heart’s pace 
<br>Stop playin’ wit me
<br>The game over a Lil Flip of the switch 
<br>Could shed light on the most
<br>The red wine for the toast
<br>The Cuervo for the nightcap
<br>That’s when we really got raw
<br>Dropped the polite act, I like that
<br>You follow your own trends
<br>You rock with your old friends 
<br>When niggas shootin’ their shot 
<br>Then you promise to goaltend 
<br>And I could be more tender 
<br>Though I’m a low spender
<br>Didn’t know it then
<br>Now I could tell that you were meant for me
<br>
<br>(Bridge)
<br>Yeah you were meant for me
<br>
<br>(Chorus - Topaz) 
<br>You were hotter as a blonde
<br>But I wouldn’t say I mind that your roots showin’
<br>Couldn’t wait to be a momma

<br>Couldn’t buy the caché with what you saved up
<br>You still a slave, even if you got your chain tucked
<br>But I won’t let a broke boy prevent my shine
<br>Made a clout bank account, just to flex online

<br>Grew up admiring rhymers who had the hot one-liners 
<br>And beats bangin’ like it’s shotgun fired (Kaboom)
<br>That left a young me inspired to light up blunts and get higher 
<br>Spend all my funds on attire and what I could consume
<br>Was spoon fed with it, rhetoric quite repetitive

<br>If I don’t blow like a bassoon

<br>If you not light on your feet, you might get crushed next
<br>Lucky to make it to a day, the way the murder rate was
<br>Them people come, we getting sprayed
<br>They might exterminate us
<br>Wonder if hate is in their heart, or is it taught?
<br>Then a daddy long leg dropped game between a cough...
<br>
<br>Ahem, Ahem
<br>Listen, by spinning the web 
<br>You could ditch these conditions and be winning instead
<br>
<br>Told me tall tales of niggas who fled 
<br>Never saw them again 
<br>Said they just busy or I ain’t visit him yet
<br>Type of shit that had me, itchin’ my head 
<br>Conflicted in bed, rolled a spliff look like I twisted a dread (ugh)
<br>Before I knew it, I was stitching a thread 
<br>Only God could predict where it lead, and so I…
<br>Ease on down the Silk Road...
<br>Strutting like a pimp, better give me what I’m owed
<br>Welcome to the big city, hit the kitchen where all the milk flows 
<br>Niggas swimming in a bowl of Cheerio’s, I froze 
<br>Was bitten by a mosquito, don’t mean to be a pest 
<br>But this is only the beginning, come and see the rest
<br>An hour later, had a corner by the fridge
<br>Threw a flick up for the fleas, show the homies how I live
<br>And now I kick it with the Beatles on the nightly
<br>I wonder why it ain’t too many out here like me
<br>They must lazy, either that or want a hand out
<br>I got like eight, still ain’t even invite the fam out
<br>Business is booming, there’s rumors I’ll expand out
<br>Visions of moving like humans through this damn house
<br>I’m hearing crickets, they hate, cause they can’t speak the language 
<br>Said “boy you buggin’, you’ll be lucky if they leave you hanging”
<br>The next morning, heard pots and pans clattering
<br>A gut curdling scream, the fine china- 
<br>A finger pointed at me, there were tears in her eyes
<br>In that moment realized, what we fear we despise 
<br>They say the rise of a king always doubles the fall
<br>Either pen or the sword, it’s just luck of the draw 
<br>And the cards that we dealt wasn’t shuffled at all
<br>Man it’s a wild goose chase, got me ducking the law
<br>I looked back to my hood before I could reconsider
<br>Ended up under somebody big momma house slipper
<br>A gust of wind, I shiver from the cold 
<br>Then I woke up to a tickle on my shoulder…
<br>
<br>I must be buggin’, gotta be buggin’ buggin’ out
<br>I must be buggin’, gotta be buggin’ buggin’ out
<br>You buggin’ out yo, yo, yo
<br>You buggin’ out yo, yo, yo
<br>
<br>(Outro)
<br>When we was at Motown, after rehearsal 
<br>Everybody went out to eat, Barry Gordy said “Everybody’s going bowling”
<br>We sisters came from Monongahela Pennsylvania
<br>There was one bowling alley- blacks were not allowed
<br>Didn’t know what to do, we had never been inside of a bowling alley before
<br>My mother always taught us-
<br>“If you don’t know what to do, be a good listener”...
